# 📊 Neural Network Process Optimization: Interaction Modeling and SPC/DOE Analysis

---

## 📝 Overview

This project develops a **neural network model** to simulate a complex process, capturing both linear and interaction effects among multiple variables. Through the use of **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** and **Design of Experiments (DOE)**, this model not only optimizes performance but also enhances understanding of intricate variable interactions, making it ideal for high-dimensional, non-linear industrial processes.

## 📈 Model Equation

The model equation combines **linear terms** with **interaction terms**, computed as follows:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n_{\text{features}}} \beta_k x_k + \sum_{i=1}^{n_{\text{features}}} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n_{\text{features}}} \beta_{ij} x_i x_j + \epsilon \]

- **\( \beta_0 \)**: Intercept term
- **\( \beta_k \)**: Coefficients for linear terms
- **\( \beta_{ij} \)**: Coefficients for interaction terms
- **\( x_k \)**: Feature values
- **\( \epsilon \)**: Random noise simulating process variability
